We care strongly about mutual support and encourage that through activities such as shout-outs, collaborations, events, and using twitch features like hosting and raiding. Our network is a safe place that helps you reach your potential alongside a fantastic group of people with the same goals.</p>\n<h2>What Do We Expect Of Members?</h2>\n<p>We are looking for members of the LGBTQ+ community who stream actively, show potential as streamers, we feel would make a good fit for our existing members, are dedicated to issues of social justice, and are willing to put in the active work to improve their own craft, and to support the network. That means streaming regularly (we suggest with a regular schedule of at least 1-2 streams a week, but there are no hard rules) and contributing actively to the network and network events. We do not take your current following or how long you have been streaming into account – one of our core aims is to help new and small streamers.</p>\n<h2>How Can You Apply?</h2>\n<p>If you think joining StreamerPride Network might be right for you, DM our official @streamerpride Twitter account with a short introduction, a link to your twitch channel, and why you think you’d be a good fit.</p>\n<p>We strongly suggest you join our Discord community before applying so we can get to know you, and to have an active Twitch profile we can refer to and watch some of your VODs and join some of your upcoming live streams.</p>\n<p>We aim to announce our first slate of additional members around the middle of this month, but will continue adding members at regular intervals afterward, so if you do not get chosen, or your application came in a bit late, we will consider you for future slates.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Call for Membership Applications!","date":"June 04, 2020","description":null}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/membership-applications/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/meet-spn/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Meet StreamerPride Network!"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/new-members/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Meet The New StreamerPride Members"}}}}}
