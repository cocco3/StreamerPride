André is a videogame streamer focusing primarily on J-RPGs, a genre he has adored since his parents bought him a Gameboy Color with Pokémon Gold as a child. He is one of the network’s co-founders and has made cultivating a welcoming experience to all a stated aim of his streams from the beginning. He tries to bring humour, filth, and occasionally the informative lense of his Japan Studies degree to his streams and the games he plays.
