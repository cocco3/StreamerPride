Hutch streams pretty much whatever he currently likes, but he has a special connection to the “The Legend of Zelda” series. He started streaming as a way to find some structure, and found it can be quite fun! He’s currently a full-time student working on a Bachelor’s in Computing & IT. He’s one of the network’s co-founders and tries to help people with technology wherever he can. He currently lives with his family in Luxembourg, with their two cats, Pandora & Merlin.
