Malik, or Blizz, is a variety streamer from the US who focuses on “just having a good time”. He started his gaming journey at a young age, playing Pokémon Crystal on his purple Game Boy Advance. Since then, he’s been finding joy from games that are lesser known, but still have heart. When he isn’t streaming, you can usually find him being a goof on social media or constantly editing episodes for his podcast. His overall streaming goal is to make sure anyone who walks into the chat feels like they are in a safe and friendly environment.
