Capn/Foam, or Kyle, spends a lot of their time exploring the vast wastelands, forests, and bays showcased not only in their favorite video games but in the great outdoors as well. They are a variety streamer that finds joy in MMORPGs, RPGs, various MOBAs, and games that focus heavily in story and character development. Twitch has become a safe space for them and building a supportive community really lights the fire inside their heart. When they are not live, you can find them cruising local eateries, writing fantasy short-stories, and dancing like no one is watching. They live in Colorado with their 2 lovely kitties: Noodle and Skedoodle.
