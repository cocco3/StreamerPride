If you watch Sam, you'll get plenty of drunk shenanigans, gay shit, and questionable dance moves. He mainly enjoys story-driven games, but he plays all sorts of titles. Sam has been a gamer since he was 5 years old and started with Donkey Kong Country on SNES. Nowadays, he's a full-fledged geek playing on his PC, PS4, and Switch. Catch him Fridays and Sundays for a good time, guaranteed!
