Rac, or Will, grew up playing The Legend of Zelda, Pokemon and spending hours in Golden Sun. He streams a variety of genres including MMORPGs, JRPGS, MOBAs and action-adventures. Streaming is his avenue to share his love of video games with others while making it engaging for viewers. Outside of gaming he cycles, tours wineries and is a full-time marketer and website manager for a health care non-profit. He lives in Virginia with his cuddly cat Boh.
