Emre (Em-ray) is a lover, child, mother, sinner, saint, AND a variety streamer with a somewhat larger focus on jRPGs and multiplayer games. He has been gaming since pre-school, social since birth, what better way to game and be social at the same than to stream? A big fan of laughs, flamboyant humour, and contemporary media, Emre enjoys peppering his streams with small talk - just like in his lessons, a warm atmosphere is always the mood. Stop by for the games, stay for the fun!
