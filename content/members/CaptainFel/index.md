Captain, or Kevin, enjoys playing and streaming RPG and action-adventure video games. Escapism via engaging stories is what got him into gaming as a child and he loves sharing these stories with his viewers. His favourite part of streaming is the community and he is one of the co-founders of SPN. He is also a massive fantasy novel, D&D, and crafting nut. Kevin lives in San Francisco with his two husbands and their dog, Dakota.
