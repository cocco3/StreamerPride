## We have exciting news!

As many of you know, after launching in late May, we went on the search for new members. We spoke to over 25 amazing streamers in the process, and ultimately selected 6 incredible people to add to our ranks, for a total of 10 StreamerPride members!

We have decided to invite **Jay** ([JonattanJay](https://www.twitch.tv/jonattanjay)), Will (rac_kuhns), Kyle (capnfoam), Malik (blizzb3ar), Emre (Cenric89) and Sam (chemicollins) into our midst. We are individually highlighting each of these new members on our twitter account and discord server in the lead-up to our pride month fundraiser on the 28th (more information available on twitter/discord and coming to the website soon). Check out the members page on this website to see all their profiles and find links to their individual twitch channels!

We will be putting out additional calls for membership applications later this year, but for now want to focus on ensuring each of these new members gets the attention and care they deserve.

**We wish our new members a warm welcome!**
