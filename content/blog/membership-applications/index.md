## Hello Friends!

StreamerPride Network has cautiously taken its first steps the other day, and now we are looking to grow beyond our 5 founding members!

If you are an LGBTQ+ streamer looking for a welcoming community and support network in which you can make a difference, you should reach out!

In the spirit of diversity and to represent the entirety of the LGBTQ+ spectrum, we would like to specifically, but not exclusively, encourage trans, non-binary, and women streamers to get in contact.

## What Does Membership Offer You?

As a member, you will be invited with open arms into a warm, positive, affirmative community of like-minded people to network with and to grow and learn together. We care strongly about mutual support and encourage that through activities such as shout-outs, collaborations, events, and using twitch features like hosting and raiding. Our network is a safe place that helps you reach your potential alongside a fantastic group of people with the same goals.

## What Do We Expect Of Members?

We are looking for members of the LGBTQ+ community who stream actively, show potential as streamers, we feel would make a good fit for our existing members, are dedicated to issues of social justice, and are willing to put in the active work to improve their own craft, and to support the network. That means streaming regularly (we suggest with a regular schedule of at least 1-2 streams a week, but there are no hard rules) and contributing actively to the network and network events. We do not take your current following or how long you have been streaming into account – one of our core aims is to help new and small streamers.

## How Can You Apply?

If you think joining StreamerPride Network might be right for you, DM our official @streamerpride Twitter account with a short introduction, a link to your twitch channel, and why you think you’d be a good fit.

We strongly suggest you join our Discord community before applying so we can get to know you, and to have an active Twitch profile we can refer to and watch some of your VODs and join some of your upcoming live streams.

We aim to announce our first slate of additional members around the middle of this month, but will continue adding members at regular intervals afterward, so if you do not get chosen, or your application came in a bit late, we will consider you for future slates.
